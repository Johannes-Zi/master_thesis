Interferon Regulatory Factor 4, transcription factor
* [[important regulator in the context of pro-inflammatory production of cytokines associated with inflammatory processes and in the development of fibrotic diseases in the mouse model]]
	
* [[IRF4 could be a viable target for the development of therapeutic interventions aimed at constraining immune reactions]]
* [[Overexpression of IRF4 in a transgenic mouse model led to aggravated cardiac hypertrophy, fibrosis, and dysfunction]]
