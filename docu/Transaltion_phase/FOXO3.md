FOXO3 is intricately linked to both pulmonary hypertension and immune cell function. It influences PASMC behavior, contributing to PAH, and interacts with immune cells like macrophages and Tregs, affecting immune responses and inflammation.
### FOXO3 and Pulmonary Hypertension

- **Role in PAH**: FOXO3 is involved in the regulation of pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells (PASMCs), which are crucial in PAH. Its nuclear exclusion due to phosphorylation leads to increased proliferation and resistance to apoptosis in PASMCs, contributing to vascular remodeling in PAH[1](https://consensus.app/results/?q=Is%20therre%20a%20connection%20between%20FOXO3%20and%20Pulmonary%20hypertension%20and%20immune%20cells%3F&pro=on#result-1).
- **Pathway Involvement**: The PI3K/Akt/FOXO3a pathway is significant in PAH, where its deregulation by M2b macrophages affects PASMC proliferation, migration, and apoptosis resistance[2](https://consensus.app/results/?q=Is%20therre%20a%20connection%20between%20FOXO3%20and%20Pulmonary%20hypertension%20and%20immune%20cells%3F&pro=on#result-2). Additionally, FOXO3 is targeted by miR-629, which influences PASMC behavior under hypoxic conditions, a common feature in PAH[7](https://consensus.app/results/?q=Is%20therre%20a%20connection%20between%20FOXO3%20and%20Pulmonary%20hypertension%20and%20immune%20cells%3F&pro=on#result-7).

### FOXO3 and Immune Cells

- **Macrophage Interaction**: M2b macrophages modulate PASMCs through the PI3K/Akt/FOXO3a pathway, indicating a link between immune cell activity and FOXO3 in PAH[2](https://consensus.app/results/?q=Is%20therre%20a%20connection%20between%20FOXO3%20and%20Pulmonary%20hypertension%20and%20immune%20cells%3F&pro=on#result-2).
- **Regulatory T Cells (Tregs)**: FOXO3 is associated with immune regulation in PAH. Tregs, which express FoxP3, are crucial in limiting vascular injury and inflammation, thereby preventing PAH development[6](https://consensus.app/results/?q=Is%20therre%20a%20connection%20between%20FOXO3%20and%20Pulmonary%20hypertension%20and%20immune%20cells%3F&pro=on#result-6). HDAC inhibitors can restore FoxP3+ Tregs, highlighting FOXO3's role in immune homeostasis and PAH pathology[3](https://consensus.app/results/?q=Is%20therre%20a%20connection%20between%20FOXO3%20and%20Pulmonary%20hypertension%20and%20immune%20cells%3F&pro=on#result-3).
