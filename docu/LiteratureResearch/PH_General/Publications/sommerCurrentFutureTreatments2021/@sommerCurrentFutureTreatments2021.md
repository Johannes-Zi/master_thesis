## Current knowledge and treatment targets
The advent of pharmacological therapies targeting the prostacyclin, endothelin, and NO pathways has significantly improved outcomes.
Current research focusses  on targeting the underlying pathways of aberrant proliferation, migration, and apoptosis. Despitesuccess in preclinical models, using a plethora of novel approaches targeting cellular GPCRs,  ion channels, metabolism, epigenetics, growth factor receptors, transcription factors, and inflammation, successful transfer to human disease with positive outcomes  in clinical trials is limited.

The initial concept that PAH is largely caused by mechanisms of vasoconstriction has been expanded over the last decades to a more complex picture in which multiple genetic, epige netic, and environmental mechanisms lead to pulmonary vascular remodelling (Humbert et al., 2019). In some regards, PAH may even be considered as a pseudo-malignant disease with similar features to cancer (apoptotic resistance, altered metabolism, and overexpression of growth factor receptors; It is now accepted that curative therapeutic approaches must address not only vasoconstriction but also vascular remodelling, by inhibiting prolifera tive and activating anti-proliferative mechanisms

==Pulmonary vascular remodelling underlying PAH is characterised by medial hypertrophy/hyperplasia, intimal and adventitial fibrosis, (in situ) thrombotic lesions, and plexiform lesions, as well as peri vascular infiltration of inflammatory cells (B- and T-lymphocytes, mast cells, dendritic cells, macrophages, etc.; Humbert et al., 2019).==

==There is evidence demonstrating that all cell types of the vascular wall (fibroblasts, pulmonary arterial endothelial cells [PAEC], pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cells [PASMC], myofibroblasts, and peri cytes) contribute to pulmonary vascular remodelling (Humbert et al., 2019). Several triggering factors combined with gen etic/epigenetic susceptibility can initiate a phenotypical change of PAEC and PASMC characterised by apoptosis resistance, increased proliferation, and migration.== [[@humbertPathologyPathobiologyPulmonary2019]]

Different mutations leading to genetic susceptibility (bone morphogenetic protein receptor 2 [BMPR2], activin receptor-like kinase 1 [ALK1], voltage gated potassium channel 1.5 [Kv1.5], and potassium channel subfamily K member 3 [KCNK3]) have been identified, and early life epigenetic imprinting may also play a role.

PAH is promoted or triggered by systemic and circulating factors such as hormones and metabolites, as well as a pro-coagulatory and inflammatory disposition, particularly in PH Group 1.4.1. (4) Endothelial dysfunction leads to an imbalanced release of endothelial factors (endothelin, Tx, NO, and prostacyclin) and is currently targeted by PAH therapy.

Further endothelial mechanisms include reduced anticoagulatory endothelial properties, increased expression of adhesion molecules (E-selectin, intercellular adhesion molecule 1, and vascular cell adhesion molecules), and endothelial release of different chemokines, cyto kines, and growth factors (Huertas et al., 2018).

Cellular mecha nisms in PAEC, PASMC, and fibroblasts include altered expression/function of ion channels and growth factor receptors, acti vation or deactivation of transcription factors (e.g., nuclear factor of activated T-cells [NFAT], hypoxia-inducible factor [HIF] 1, signal transducer and activator of transcription [STAT] 3, and forkhead box protein [FOX] O1), and dysregulated cellular metabolism. (6) Finally, repair mechanisms counteracting remodelling are disturbed, including DNA and endothelial repair mechanisms

==The multifactorial nature of PAH may be one of the reasons why finding a cure for PAH is challenging.==

There are currently studies ongoing in large populations with idiopathic PAH (IPAH) and heritable PAH to identify further mutations or polymor phisms that could represent a “second hit.” Several candidates have been identified, including variants in the prostacyclin synthase gene and mutations in the potassium voltage-gated channel sub-family A member 5 gene

In PAH, current pharmacological therapies target three pathways regulating endothelial factors with vasoconstrictive/vasodilatory and proliferative/mitogenic properties: (1) NO-cGMP signalling is targeted by PDE5 inhibitors (tadalafil and sildenafil) and a soluble GC stimula tor (riociguat); (2) endothelin receptor antagonists (ERAs) target both ETA and ETB receptors non-selectively (bosentan) orETA receptors selectively (ambrisentan and macitentan. This selectivity may be advantageous because stimulation of ETA receptors causes vasocon striction whereas stimulation of ETB receptors causes vasodilation); and (3) prostacyclin signalling is increased by either parenteral prosta cyclin analogues (epoprostenol, treprostinil, and iloprost) or an orally available IP receptor agonist (selexipag; Galie et al., 2015).

Recent improvements in outcomes for patients with PAH reflect a move to the use of combination drug therapy targeting multiple pathways.

## Novel treatment targets for PAH
### Sex hormones
"oestrogen paradox" - men behave different that woman. Difficult to view at from our small dataset point of view.

### Dehydroepiandrosterone
steroid hormone that serves as a precursor for both oestrogen and testosterone synthesis
Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA)

### Renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system
Antagonists of the receptor for aldosterone, a steroid hormone that binds the mineralocorticoid receptor in the heart and pulmonary vasculature, have been used for fluid management in PAH.

Another novel approach addresses the peptidase ACE2 which converts the peptide hormones angiotensin I and angiotensin II to their vasodilator derivates (angiotensin-(1–9) and angiotensin-(1–7), respectively) with a preference for angiotensin II degradation.

### Atrial natriuretic peptide
Atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) and brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) are released from atrial cardiomyocytes or the ventricles respectively.
... in combination with PDE5 inhibition attenu ated PH in chronic hypoxic rats ...

### Neurohormonal regulation
Neurohormonal regulation plays an important role in pulmonary vascular tone and RV function (Maron & Leopold, 2015). In fact, β-blockers (β-adrenoceptor antagonists) are one of the main treat ment strategies in left ventricular systolic dysfunction and may thus have a place in PAH therapy (beyond their indication for sup raventricular tachycardia which is a frequent co-morbidity in PAH).

Thus, further studies are planned with a selective inhibitor of tryptophanhydroxylase 1 (TPH1) which is the rate-limiting enzyme in 5-HT biosynthesis.

### Other hormones
Several other hormones have effects on the cardiopulmonary system. One of the long-standing hormones investigated in the field of PAH is vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), a peptide hormone that stimulates contractility in the heart and causes dilation of smooth muscles of dif ferent organs, including blood vessels.

### GPCR pathways
Rho-associated protein kinase (ROCK) belongs to the family of serine–threonine kinases and can be activated via the GTPase RhoA by several cellular receptors, including GPCRs which are stimulated by various vasoactive substances such as angiotensin II or 5-HT.
ROCK inhibi tors have shown promising results in animal studies

Apelin is an endogenous vasodilatory and inotropic peptide acting via the G protein-coupled apelin receptor. Apelin is down-regulated in human PAH and can inhibit PH in animal models.

### Novel preclinical targets
Future approaches may include activation of NO release and inhibi tion of RhoA/ROCK signalling by activation of the G protein-coupled adenosine A2A receptor (Alencar, Montes, Barreiro, Sudo, & Zapata Sudo, 2017).

Wnt/planar cell polarity pathway - Wnt5a

Very recent studies also suggest a role for glutaminergic NMDA receptors (Dumas et al., 2018).

Mitochondrial and metabolic adaptation - skipped not fitting our dataset, but there are many different mechanisms associated to PAH

##### Epigenetic alterations and interaction with metabolic pathways
==The role of epigenetics in PAH is a fast-growing field of research. The major epigenetic phenomena include DNA methylation, histone modi fications, and modulations of non-coding RNAs (reviewed in Chelladurai et al., 2019; Pullamsetti, Perros, Chelladurai, Yuan, & Stenmark, 2016).==
Recently, clinical interest in histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibi tion in PAH has been rekindled by the discovery that the cytosolic HDAC6 is involved in both pulmonary arterial remodelling and RV fail ure (Boucherat, Chabot, et al., 2017). This isoenzyme represents an important pharmacological target for selective inhibition that may reduce the toxicity related to the off-target effects of pan-HDAC inhibitors previously described in PAH (Bogaard et al., 2011).

Consistent with these findings, mice lacking SIRT3, a mitochondrial deacetylase, have increased acetylation and inhibition of many mitochondrial enzymes and complexes, suppressing mitochondrial oxidative metabolism.

The importance of this metabolism–epigenetics axis has been further highlighted by the recent clinical trial results using DCA, a pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase inhibitor known to promote glucose oxidation (see above).
The DCA trial showed that functional variants of SIRT3 and UCP2 largely influenced the clinical and haemodynamic response to DCA (Michelakis et al., 2017).
Inhibition of PARP1 in conjunction with stan dard combination therapy (ERA + PDE5 inhibitor) in an experimental PHmodel showed greater efficacy than standard combination therapy alone (Meloche et al., 2014),

==The epigenetic/metabolism/DNA damage response axis described above in PAH is very similar to that described in cancer. This cancer theory of PAH (Boucherat, Vitry, et al., 2017) is further reinforced by the implication of the newly described epigenetic reader, bromodomain-containing protein 4 (BRD4), in PAH.==
==Although these effects were attributed to the modulation of NFAT, Bcl-2, Survivin, and p21, other mechanisms cannot be excluded. The mechanisms accounting for BRD4 inhibitor efficacy in PAH are the subject of numerous published and ongoing preclinical studies. In addition to its effects on the cancer-like phenotype of PASMCs, the inhibition of autoimmune-mediated/inflammatory vascular injuries==
##### Oxidative stress-related pathways
The pleiotropic effects of ROS on metabolism and inflammation in PH were recently explored. Inhibition of apoptosis signal regulating kinase 1 (ASK1; MAP3K5) a serine/threonine kinase that is activated by oxidative stress, promoting inflammation, ROS produc tion, proliferation, fibrosis, apoptosis, mitochondrial damage, and, under certain contexts, insulin resistance) reduced pathological remodelling and halted progression of PH in rodent models (Budas et al., 2018). Despite these encouraging results, a Phase 2 study (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02234141) evaluating the ASK1 inhibitor selonsertib did not achieve its primary endpoint in PAH (Boucherat, Provencher, & Bonnet, 2018). Conversely, a Phase 2 clini cal trial evaluating bardoxolone, an activator of the nuclear factor ery throid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), a transcription factor that regulates antioxidant proteins and suppresses activation of the pro inflammatory factor NF-κB, showed significant improvements in exer cise capacity in PAH

##### **==Inflammatory mediators==**
###### Immune modulators in PAH
Immune modulation is an established concept in PAH, but classic anti inflammatory drugs such as corticosteroids or acetylsalicylic acid have shown beneficial effects only in specific forms of PAH (Sanchez, Sitbon, Jais, Simonneau, & Humbert, 2006)
However, interest in the field has been revived by an improved understanding of immune regulation in PAH and the notion that perivascular inflammatory infiltrates (macrophages, B-cells, T-cells, and dendritic cells) often precede structural pulmonary vascu lar remodelling (Tamosiuniene et al., 2011).
Histopathological studies have demonstrated the presence of complement system components, autoantibodies, and inflammatory cells (neutrophils) in the vessel lumen, which can bind to the endothelium and may infiltrate the medial muscular layer. The inflammatory infiltrate in the neointimal layer is composed of T- and B-lymphocytes, with macrophages, mast cells, and dendritic cells present in the adventitial layer. Lymphoid fol licles, characterised by T-cells, B-cells, and plasmacytoid dendritic cells, are found in the periadventitial space (see Rabinovitch, Guignabert, Humbert, & Nicolls, 2014).
Although current knowledge of the immune system is far from complete, increasing evidence sug gests that excessive local secretion of inflammatory mediators by pulmonary vascular cells (e.g., IL-1β, IL-6, LTB4, macrophage migration inhibitory factor, leptin, and TNF-α) as well as dysregulated immune responses (innate [through macrophages and monocytes] and adap tive [impaired T-regulatory cell function and T-helper 17 cell immune polarisation]) are major drivers of pulmonary remodelling in PAH with or without autoimmune diseases (see Kuebler, Bonnet, & Tabuchi, 2018; Rabinovitch et al., 2014).
Several immune modulatory approaches have been successfully tested in animal models, including an IL-1 receptor antagonist, IL-6 antibodies, mycophenolate, dexamethasone, cyclosporine, tacrolimus, LTB4 pathway inhibitors, and TNF-related apoptosis inducing ligand (Rabinovitch et al., 2014), but none have yet made the transition to treatment of human PAH beyond CTD-PAH.
A different approach uses the endogenous protein elafin which inhibits the neutrophil derived serine proteases elastase and proteinase-3.
Recently, it was reported that fucoidan, a polysaccharidic ligand of the adhesion molecule P-selectin, exhibits anti-proliferative properties and can attenuate hypoxia-induced PH in mice.
Moreover, the damage associated high mobility group box-1 (HMGB1)—which is secreted from immune cells, activates macrophages as well as lymphocytes, and triggers autoimmunity by binding to the toll-like receptor 4 ( TLR4)—was shown to be involved in development of PH.
