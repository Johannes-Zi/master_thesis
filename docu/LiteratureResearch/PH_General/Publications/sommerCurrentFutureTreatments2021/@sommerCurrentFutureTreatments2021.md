## Current treatment targets
The advent of pharmacological therapies targeting the prostacyclin, endothelin, and NO pathways has significantly improved outcomes.
Current research focusses  on targeting the underlying pathways of aberrant proliferation, migration, and apoptosis. Despitesuccess in preclinical models, using a plethora of novel approaches targeting cellular GPCRs,  ion channels, metabolism, epigenetics, growth factor receptors, transcription factors, and inflammation, successful transfer to human disease with positive outcomes  in clinical trials is limited.

The initial concept that PAH is largely caused by mechanisms of vasoconstriction has been expanded over the last decades to a more complex picture in which multiple genetic, epige netic, and environmental mechanisms lead to pulmonary vascular remodelling (Humbert et al., 2019). In some regards, PAH may even be considered as a pseudo-malignant disease with similar features to cancer (apoptotic resistance, altered metabolism, and overexpression of growth factor receptors; It is now accepted that curative therapeutic approaches must address not only vasoconstriction but also vascular remodelling, by inhibiting prolifera tive and activating anti-proliferative mechanisms

==Pulmonary vascular remodelling underlying PAH is characterised by medial hypertrophy/hyperplasia, intimal and adventitial fibrosis, (in situ) thrombotic lesions, and plexiform lesions, as well as peri vascular infiltration of inflammatory cells (B- and T-lymphocytes, mast cells, dendritic cells, macrophages, etc.; Humbert et al., 2019).==

==There is evidence demonstrating that all cell types of the vascular wall (fibroblasts, pulmonary arterial endothelial cells [PAEC], pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cells [PASMC], myofibroblasts, and peri cytes) contribute to pulmonary vascular remodelling (Humbert et al., 2019). Several triggering factors combined with gen etic/epigenetic susceptibility can initiate a phenotypical change of PAEC and PASMC characterised by apoptosis resistance, increased proliferation, and migration.== [[@humbertPathologyPathobiologyPulmonary2019]]

Different mutations leading to genetic susceptibility (bone morphogenetic protein receptor 2 [BMPR2], activin receptor-like kinase 1 [ALK1], voltage gated potassium channel 1.5 [Kv1.5], and potassium channel subfamily K member 3 [KCNK3]) have been identified, and early life epigenetic imprinting may also play a role.

PAH is promoted or trig gered by systemic and circulating factors such as hormones and metabolites, as well as a pro-coagulatory and inflammatory disposi tion, particularly in PH Group 1.4.1. (4) Endothelial dysfunction leads to an imbalanced release of endothelial factors (endothelin, Tx, NO, and prostacyclin) and is currently targeted by PAH therapy.
