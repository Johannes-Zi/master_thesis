TGF-β signaling pathway
```
This supports the hypothesis that mutations in genes involved in the TGF-β signaling pathway may be a trigger for pulmon ary vascular remodeling. Moreover, this signaling path way controls growth, differentiation and apoptosis of various cell types like pulmonary vascular endothelial cells (ECs) and smooth muscle cells (SMCs). Thereby, mutations in genes involved in the TGF-β signaling pathway may be responsible for abnormal proliferation of pulmonary vascular SMCs and may promote ECs apoptosis, which might lead to the selection of apoptosis resistant cells and formation of plexiform lesions, the hallmark of idiopathic PAH [131,132].

## Cellular Factors
Cellular factors Proliferation of smooth muscular cells in the small per ipheral pulmonary arteries is a common characteristic in all forms of PAH. In hypoxic models, fibroblasts of the adventitia migrate to the media and intima, where prolif eration and production of matrix proteins are observed [138]. Neovascularization, mainly of the adventitia, oc curs concomitantly to the thickening of the vascular walls [139]. In response

The stimuli for endothelial prolif eration is still unknown but several factors have been in criminated such as hypoxia, inflammation, shear stress, drugs, viral infections and genetic susceptibility.
The CXCL12/CXCR4 axis may play an important role in the pulmonary recruitment of these circulating progenitors and can be therapeutically targeted

Inflammatory mechanisms seems to play an important role in certain forms of PAH such as PAH associated with auto immune diseases or HIV infection

Thirty to 40% of patients with PAH have circulating auto-antibodies and elevated plasma concentrations of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin 1 (IL-1) and interleukin-6 (IL-6), and chemokines such as fractalkine and MCP-1 [145,146]. Inflammatory cells, such as lymphocytes B and T, mac rophages, mastocytes and dendritic cells, can also be found in plexiform lesions of severe PAH [147,148]. Chemokines, like RANTES and fractalkine are also overly expressed in the pulmonary vascular endothelium of PAH patients [145].

In response to certain stimuli, platelets can produce prothrombotic, vasoactive or mitogenic factors, such as thromboxane A2 (TXA2), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), serotonin (5 hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT), transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) that participate in vasoconstriction and vascular remodeling

One can propose that deregulated and unresolved pulmonary inflammation on the background of a genetic predispos ition, could result in persisting vascular remodelling leading to PAH. An initial acute inflammation that is normally expected to resolve with return to homeostasis, could conduct the production of auto-antibodies against vascular wall components, and would shift to chronic persisting and chronic inflammation, endothelial barrier breakdown, infiltration by immune cells, local and chronic autoimmunity, and vascular remodeling culmin ating in PAH

Vasoconstriction has been associated with an abnormal function or Page 10 of 28 Montani et al. Orphanet Journal of Rare Diseases 2013, 8:97 http://www.ojrd.com/content/8/1/97 expression of potassium channels and with endothelial dysfunction [107]. Endothelial dysfunction results in a decreased production of vasodilators such as nitric oxide (NO) and prostacyclin and an increased production of vasoconstrictors such as endothelin-1 [153]. Prostacyclin (prostaglandin I2) is a potent pulmon ary vasodilator that acts via the cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) pathway. It inhibits the pro liferation of smooth muscle cells and decreases plate let aggregation. Production of prostacyclin is reduced in endothelial cells of patients with PAH [154]

NO is also a pulmonary vasodilator which acts via the cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) pathway. To increase pulmonary vasodilatation de pendant on NO, a recent therapeutic strategy has targeted type 5 phosphodiesterase which degrades cGMP. Sildenafil or tadalafil, type 5 phosphodiesterase inhibitors, have proven their efficacy in patients with PAH [155]. Vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) is a neurotransmitter that has systemic and pulmonary vasodilator properties. It also inhibits smooth cell proliferation and decreases platelet aggregation and acts via the activation of the cAMP and cGMP sys tems [156].

By ligating the ETRA, ET-1 intracellular calcium concentrations increase and activates the protein kinase C pathway [157]. ET-1 is a potent pul monary vasoconstrictor and stimulates mitosis of arterial smooth muscle cells, thus contributing to pulmonary vascu lar remodeling.

Rho protein A and Rho kinases in the vasoconstriction and vascular remod eling of PAH, 5-HTT/RhoA/Rho

Hypoxia inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) is a transcription factor that principally regulates cellular adaptation to hypoxia but also regulates several genes implicated in angiogenesis, erythropoiesis, cellular metabolism and survival [168].

==In conclusion, the pathophysiology of PAH is hetero geneous and multifactorial. The genetic mutations found in familial PAH and in a proportion of sporadic PAH are neither necessary nor sufficient for the development of PAH. Therefore, the current hypothesis is that of a gen etic predisposition for PAH followed by a superimposed environmental factor (infection, inflammation, auto immunity).==

## Known therapeutic targets
Several specific therapeutic agents were developed for the medical man agement of PAH including prostanoids, endothelin receptor antagonists and phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors. Furthermore, emerging treatments such as tyrosine kinase inhibitors, soluble guanylate cyclase activators (riociguat) and prostacyclin receptor agonists (selexipag) are cur rently being evaluated in PAH

Calcium channel blockers (CCB) are indicated in pa tients with a positive vasodilatation challenge test after inhaled NO. CCB are vasodilators and were initially

Endothelium-derived prostaglandin I2 (PGI2), or prostacyc lin, is an arachidonic acid produced by endothelial cells. Prostacyclin is a powerful systemic and pulmonary vaso dilator and an inhibitor of platelet aggregation through the increase in intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)

There are two existing isoforms of ET-1 recep tors: endothelin A (ETRA) and endothelin B (ETRB). Activation of ETRA and ETRB on pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells induce proliferation and vasoconstriction, whereas activation of ETRB on pulmonary endothelial cells leads to release of NO and prostacyclin and partici pate to the clearance of circulating ET-1

Phosphodiesterase type-5 inhibitors NO is a potent pulmonary arteries SMC relaxant that disposed vasodilator activity through up-regulation of its associated down-stream signalling molecule, cyclic GMP (cGMP), metabolism of which is dependent on the activation of a number of PDEs [208]. Phospho diesterase type 3, 4 and 5 are the three main types of this enzyme found in pulmonary artery contractive cells. PDE-5 is the most abundantly expressed isoform in pulmonary circulation which was confirmed by several experimental investigations showing a benefi cial effect of PDE-5 inhibitors on vascular remodel ling and vasodilatation [234,235].

Sildenafil is an oral PDE-5 inhibitor that is available in Europe since 2005

Riociguat is a first in-class drug that augments cGMP biosynthesis through direct stimulation of the enzyme soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC) promoting vasodilatation by direct stimulation of sGC in an NO-independent fashion, and by sensitization of sGC to low endogenous NO levels [250].

Selexipag is an orally active prodrug metabolized to the highly selective prostacyclin IP receptor agonist ACT-333679

One of the most promising targets in PAH is platelet derived growth factor (PDGF). PDGF has been implicated in endothelial cell dysfunction and prolifera tion and migration of smooth muscle cells.
