### NCBI Gene Summary for USP44 Gene

[](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/84101)

- The protein encoded by this gene is a protease that functions as a deubiquitinating enzyme. The encoded protein is thought to help regulate the spindle assembly checkpoint by preventing early anaphase onset. This protein specifically deubiquitinates CDC20, which stabilizes the anaphase promoting complex/cyclosome. [provided by RefSeq, Dec 2016]

### UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot Summary for USP44 Gene

Deubiquitinase that plays a key regulatory role in the spindle assembly checkpoint or mitotic checkpoint by preventing premature anaphase onset. Acts by specifically mediating deubiquitination of CDC20, a negative regulator of the anaphase promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C) (PubMed:[17443180](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17443180)). Deubiquitination of CDC20 leads to stabilize the MAD2L1-CDC20-APC/C ternary complex (also named mitotic checkpoint complex), thereby preventing premature activation of the APC/C (PubMed:[17443180](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17443180)). Promotes association of MAD2L1 with CDC20 and reinforces the spindle assembly checkpoint (PubMed:[17443180](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17443180)). Promotes also the deubiquitination of histone H2A and H2B (PubMed:[23615962](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23615962), [27880911](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27880911)). Recruited to RNF8/RNF168-ubiquitinated chromatin surrounding double stranded breaks (DSBs), promotes hydrolysis of such ubiquitin conjugates, thus negatively regulating protein recruitment to damaged chromatin (PubMed:[23615962](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23615962)). Participates in nucleotide excision repair (NER) pathway by deubiquitinating DDB2 to prevent its premature degradation so it can remain on damaged chromatin (By similarity). Promotes FOXP3 stabilization through 'Lys-48'-linked deubiquitination leading to increased stability and increased regulatory T-cell lineage stability (PubMed:[32644293](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32644293)). Plays also a positive role in innate immune response to DNA viruses by deubiquitinating STING1, selectively removing its 'Lys-48'-linked polyubiquitin chains and stabilizing it (PubMed:[31968013](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31968013)).
