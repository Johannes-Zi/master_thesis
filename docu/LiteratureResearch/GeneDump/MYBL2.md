### NCBI Gene Summary for MYBL2 Gene

[](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/4605)

- The protein encoded by this gene, a member of the MYB family of transcription factor genes, is a nuclear protein involved in cell cycle progression. The encoded protein is phosphorylated by cyclin A/cyclin-dependent kinase 2 during the S-phase of the cell cycle and possesses both activator and repressor activities. It has been shown to activate the cell division cycle 2, cyclin D1, and insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 5 genes. Two transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2013]
