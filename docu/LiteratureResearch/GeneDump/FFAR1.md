### NCBI Gene Summary for FFAR1 Gene

[](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2864)

- This gene encodes a member of the GP40 family of G protein-coupled receptors that are clustered together on chromosome 19. The encoded protein is a receptor for medium and long chain free fatty acids and may be involved in the metabolic regulation of insulin secretion. Polymorphisms in this gene may be associated with type 2 diabetes. [provided by RefSeq, Apr 2009]
