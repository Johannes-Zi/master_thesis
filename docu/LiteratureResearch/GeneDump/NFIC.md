### NCBI Gene Summary for NFIC Gene

[](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/4782)

- The protein encoded by this gene belongs to the CTF/NF-I family. These are dimeric DNA-binding proteins, and function as cellular transcription factors and as replication factors for adenovirus DNA replication. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been described for this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Oct 2011]
