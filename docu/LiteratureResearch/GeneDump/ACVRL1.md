# Info
Genetic mutations, particularly in the ACVRL1 gene, have been implicated in the pathogenesis of PAH. ACVRL1, also known as activin receptor-like kinase 1 (ALK1), is crucial for vascular development and function.
### NCBI Gene Summary for ACVRL1 Gene
[](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/94)

- This gene encodes a type I cell-surface receptor for the TGF-beta superfamily of ligands. It shares with other type I receptors a high degree of similarity in serine-threonine kinase subdomains, a glycine- and serine-rich region (called the GS domain) preceding the kinase domain, and a short C-terminal tail. The encoded protein, sometimes termed ALK1, shares similar domain structures with other closely related ALK or activin receptor-like kinase proteins that form a subfamily of receptor serine/threonine kinases. Mutations in this gene are associated with hemorrhagic telangiectasia type 2, also known as Rendu-Osler-Weber syndrome 2. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]
