### NCBI Gene Summary for TRAF5 Gene

[](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/7188)

- The scaffold protein encoded by this gene is a member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor (TRAF) protein family and contains a meprin and TRAF homology (MATH) domain, a RING-type zinc finger, and two TRAF-type zinc fingers. TRAF proteins are associated with, and mediate signal transduction from members of the TNF receptor superfamily. This protein is one of the components of a multiple protein complex which binds to tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor cytoplasmic domains and mediates TNF-induced activation. Multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Jan 2016]
