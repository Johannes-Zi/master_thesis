### NCBI Gene Summary for PROK2 Gene

[](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/60675)

- This gene encodes a protein expressed in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) circadian clock that may function as the output component of the circadian clock. The secreted form of the encoded protein may also serve as a chemoattractant for neuronal precursor cells in the olfactory bulb. Proteins from other vertebrates which are similar to this gene product were isolated based on homology to snake venom and secretions from frog skin, and have been shown to have diverse functions. Mutations in this gene are associated with Kallmann syndrome 4. Multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]
