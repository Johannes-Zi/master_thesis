### NCBI Gene Summary for SLC24A3 Gene

[](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/57419)

- Plasma membrane sodium/calcium exchangers are an important component of intracellular calcium homeostasis and electrical conduction. Potassium-dependent sodium/calcium exchangers such as SLC24A3 are believed to transport 1 intracellular calcium and 1 potassium ion in exchange for 4 extracellular sodium ions (Kraev et al., 2001 [PubMed 11294880]).[supplied by OMIM, Mar 2008]

### Consensus
Studies suggest a connection between calcium and pulmonary hypertension through mechanisms involving calcium-sensing receptors, T-type voltage-gated calcium channels, and calcium-activated chloride channels, which contribute to pulmonary vasoconstriction, vascular remodeling, and smooth muscle cell proliferation.
