### NCBI Gene Summary for FSCN2 Gene

[](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/25794)

- This gene encodes a member of the fascin protein family. Fascins crosslink actin into filamentous bundles within dynamic cell extensions. This family member is proposed to play a role in photoreceptor disk morphogenesis. A mutation in this gene results in one form of autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa and macular degeneration. Multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]
