### NCBI Gene Summary for PDE9A Gene

[](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/5152)

- The protein encoded by this gene catalyzes the hydrolysis of cAMP and cGMP to their corresponding monophosphates. The encoded protein plays a role in signal transduction by regulating the intracellular concentration of these cyclic nucleotides. Multiple transcript variants encoding several different isoforms have been found for this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]
