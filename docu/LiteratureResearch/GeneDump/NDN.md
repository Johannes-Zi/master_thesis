### NCBI Gene Summary for NDN Gene

[](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/4692)

- This intronless gene is located in the Prader-Willi syndrome deletion region. It is an imprinted gene and is expressed exclusively from the paternal allele. Studies in mouse suggest that the protein encoded by this gene may suppress growth in postmitotic neurons. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]
