### NCBI Gene Summary for UBR4 Gene

[](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/23352)

- The protein encoded by this gene is an E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase that interacts with the retinoblastoma-associated protein in the nucleus and with calcium-bound calmodulin in the cytoplasm. The encoded protein appears to be a cytoskeletal component in the cytoplasm and part of the chromatin scaffold in the nucleus. In addition, this protein is a target of the human papillomavirus type 16 E7 oncoprotein. [provided by RefSeq, Aug 2010]
