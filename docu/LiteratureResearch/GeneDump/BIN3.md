### NCBI Gene Summary for BIN3 Gene

[](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/55909)

- The product of this gene is a member of the BAR domain protein family. The encoded protein is comprised solely of a BAR domain which is predicted to form coiled-coil structures and proposed to mediate dimerization, sense and induce membrane curvature, and bind small GTPases. BAR domain proteins have been implicated in endocytosis, intracellular transport, and a diverse set of other processes. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]
