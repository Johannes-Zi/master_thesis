### NCBI Gene Summary for BATF3 Gene

[](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/55509)

- This gene encodes a member of the basic leucine zipper protein family. The encoded protein functions as a transcriptional repressor when heterodimerizing with JUN. The protein may play a role in repression of interleukin-2 and matrix metalloproteinase-1 transcription.[provided by RefSeq, Feb 2009]
