### NCBI Gene Summary for PARD3 Gene

[](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/56288)

- This gene encodes a member of the PARD protein family. PARD family members interact with other PARD family members and other proteins; they affect asymmetrical cell division and direct polarized cell growth. Multiple alternatively spliced transcript variants have been described for this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Oct 2011]
