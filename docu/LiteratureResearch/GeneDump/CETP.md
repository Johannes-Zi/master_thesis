### NCBI Gene Summary for CETP Gene

[](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/1071)

- The protein encoded by this gene is found in plasma, where it is involved in the transfer of cholesteryl ester from high density lipoprotein (HDL) to other lipoproteins. Defects in this gene are a cause of hyperalphalipoproteinemia 1 (HALP1). Two transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Oct 2013]
