### NCBI Gene Summary for MAOB Gene

[](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/4129)

- The protein encoded by this gene belongs to the flavin monoamine oxidase family. It is a enzyme located in the mitochondrial outer membrane. It catalyzes the oxidative deamination of biogenic and xenobiotic amines and plays an important role in the metabolism of neuroactive and vasoactive amines in the central nervous sysytem and peripheral tissues. This protein preferentially degrades benzylamine and phenylethylamine. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]
