### NCBI Gene Summary for DEPP1 Gene

[](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/11067)

- The expression of this gene is induced by fasting as well as by progesterone. The protein encoded by this gene contains a t-synaptosome-associated protein receptor (SNARE) coiled-coil homology domain and a peroxisomal targeting signal. Production of the encoded protein leads to phosphorylation and activation of the transcription factor ELK1. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]
