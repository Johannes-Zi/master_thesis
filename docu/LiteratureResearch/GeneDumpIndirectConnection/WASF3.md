### NCBI Gene Summary for WASF3 Gene

[](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/10810)

- This gene encodes a member of the Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein family. The gene product is a protein that forms a multiprotein complex that links receptor kinases and actin. Binding to actin occurs through a C-terminal verprolin homology domain in all family members. The multiprotein complex serves to tranduce signals that involve changes in cell shape, motility or function. A pseudogene of this gene have been defined on chromosome 6. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants [provided by RefSeq, May 2014]
