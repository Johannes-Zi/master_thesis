### NCBI Gene Summary for ADM2 Gene

[](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/79924)

- This gene encodes a member of the calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP)/calcitonin family of hormones that play a role in the regulation of cardiovascular homeostasis, prolactin release, anti-diuresis, anti-natriuresis, and regulation of food and water intake. The encoded protein is proteolytically processed to generate one or more biologically active peptides. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2015]
