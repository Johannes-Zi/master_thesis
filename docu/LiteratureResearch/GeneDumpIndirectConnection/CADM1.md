### GeneCards Summary for CADM1 Gene

CADM1 (Cell Adhesion Molecule 1) is a Protein Coding gene. Diseases associated with CADM1 include [Cervix Uteri Carcinoma In Situ](http://www.malacards.org/card/cervix_uteri_carcinoma_in_situ "See Cervix Uteri Carcinoma In Situ at MalaCards") and [Parapsoriasis](http://www.malacards.org/card/parapsoriasis "See Parapsoriasis at MalaCards"). Among its related pathways are [Cell junction organization](https://pathcards.genecards.org/card/cell_junction_organization "See Cell junction organization at Pathcards") and [Splicing factor NOVA regulated synaptic proteins](https://pathcards.genecards.org/card/splicing_factor_nova_regulated_synaptic_proteins "See Splicing factor NOVA regulated synaptic proteins at Pathcards"). Gene Ontology (GO) annotations related to this gene include _protein homodimerization activity_ and _PDZ domain binding_. An important paralog of this gene is [CADM2](https://www.genecards.org/cgi-bin/carddisp.pl?gene=CADM2).
