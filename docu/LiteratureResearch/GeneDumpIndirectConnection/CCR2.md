### NCBI Gene Summary for CCR2 Gene

[](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/729230)

- The protein encoded by this gene is a receptor for monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, a chemokine which specifically mediates monocyte chemotaxis. Monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 is involved in monocyte infiltration in inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis as well as in the inflammatory response against tumors. The encoded protein mediates agonist-dependent calcium mobilization and inhibition of adenylyl cyclase. This protein can also be a coreceptor with CD4 for HIV-1 infection. This gene is located in the chemokine receptor gene cluster region of chromosome 3. [provided by RefSeq, Aug 2017]
