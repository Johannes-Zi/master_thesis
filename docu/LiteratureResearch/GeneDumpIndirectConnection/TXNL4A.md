### NCBI Gene Summary for TXNL4A Gene

[](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/10907)

- The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the U5 small ribonucleoprotein particle (snRNP), and is involved in pre-mRNA splicing. This protein contains a thioredoxin-like fold and it is expected to interact with multiple proteins. Protein-protein interactions have been observed with the polyglutamine tract-binding protein 1 (PQBP1). Mutations in both the coding region and promoter region of this gene have been associated with Burn-McKeown syndrome, which is a rare disorder characterized by craniofacial dysmorphisms, cardiac defects, hearing loss, and bilateral choanal atresia. A pseudogene of this gene is found on chromosome 2. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants. [provided by RefSeq, Mar 2015]
