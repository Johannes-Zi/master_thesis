### NCBI Gene Summary for PEX11G Gene

[](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/92960)

- The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the PEX11 family. This family is reported to regulate the number and size of peroxisomes in evolutionarily distant organisms. The protein encoded by this gene may induce clustering of peroxisomes. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants that encode different protein isoforms.
