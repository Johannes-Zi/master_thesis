ENSG00000131398, potassium voltage-gated channel subfamily C member 3

### NCBI Gene Summary for KCNC3 Gene

[](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/3748)

- The Shaker gene family of Drosophila encodes components of voltage-gated potassium channels and is comprised of four subfamilies. Based on sequence similarity, this gene is similar to one of these subfamilies, namely the Shaw subfamily. The protein encoded by this gene belongs to the delayed rectifier class of channel proteins and is an integral membrane protein that mediates the voltage-dependent potassium ion permeability of excitable membranes. Alternate splicing results in several transcript variants. [provided by RefSeq, Mar 2014]
