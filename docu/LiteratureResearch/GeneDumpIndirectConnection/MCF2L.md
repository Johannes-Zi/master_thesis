### NCBI Gene Summary for MCF2 Gene
[](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/4168)
- The oncogenic protein encoded by this gene is a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) that exerts control over some members of the Rho family of small GTPases. Several transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene. These isoforms exhibit different expression patterns and varying levels of GEF activity.[provided by RefSeq, Jan 2010]
