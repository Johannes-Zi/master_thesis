### NCBI Gene Summary for RND1 Gene

[](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/27289)

- This gene encodes a protein that belongs to the Rho GTPase family. Members of this family regulate the organization of the actin cytoskeleton in response to extracellular growth factors. A similar protein in rat interacts with a microtubule regulator to control axon extension. [provided by RefSeq, Apr 2014]
