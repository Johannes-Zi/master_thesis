| [[Prostacyclin]]<br>         | studies suggest that prostacyclin and its analogs can reduce pulmonary arterial pressure and improve hemodynamics in pulmonary hypertension, though their effects on exercise capacity and lung function may var                                              |
| [[Endothelin]]               | studies suggest a connection between endothelin and pulmonary hypertension, with endothelin-1 contributing to increased vascular tone, smooth muscle proliferation, and vascular remodeling in pulmonary hypertensi                                           |
| [[Phosphodiesterase]]        | studies suggest that phosphodiesterase inhibitors, particularly PDE5 inhibitors, are effective in treating pulmonary hypertension by inducing vasodilation, reducing arterial pressure, and inhibiting smooth muscle proliferation in the pulmonary arteries. |
| [[Calcium Channel]]          | studies suggest a connection between calcium channels and pulmonary hypertension, indicating that calcium-activated chloride channels and voltage-dependent calcium channels play significant roles in the disease's pathogenesis and vascular remode .       |
| [[Tyrosine kinase receptor]] | studies suggest that tyrosine kinase receptors, including PDGF receptor, VEGFR-2, and c-Src, are involved in the pathogenesis and progression of pulmonary hypertension                                                                                       |
| [[PDGF]]                     | studies suggest a connection between PDGF signaling and pulmonary hypertension, indicating that PDGF contributes to vascular remodeling and the progression of the disease.                                                                                   |
