### Consensus
LIF signaling plays a fundamental and pivotal role in the pathogenesis of pulmonary hypertension, and isoform-specific inhibition may be a novel therapeutic strategy for this condition.(https://consensus.app/papers/factor-signaling-hypertension-pullamsetti/d6b431bf8353544c85889eef0e7c91cf/?extracted-answer=LIF+signaling+plays+a+fundamental+and+pivotal+role+in+the+pathogenesis+of+pulmonary+hypertension%2C+and+isoform-specific+inhibition+may+be+a+novel+therapeutic+strategy+for+this+condition.&q=connection+between+LIF+and+pulmanory+hypertension&synthesize=on&copilot=on&lang=en)

### NCBI Gene Summary for LIF Gene

[](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/3976)

- The protein encoded by this gene is a pleiotropic cytokine with roles in several different systems. It is involved in the induction of hematopoietic differentiation in normal and myeloid leukemia cells, induction of neuronal cell differentiation, regulator of mesenchymal to epithelial conversion during kidney development, and may also have a role in immune tolerance at the maternal-fetal interface. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding multiple isoforms have been observed for this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Mar 2012]
