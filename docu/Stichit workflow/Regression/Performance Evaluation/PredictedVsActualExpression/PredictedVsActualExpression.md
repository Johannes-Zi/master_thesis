After the [[OnlyZeroCoeffOLS]]  the [[Performance_Overview.txt | Performance Evaluation]], for each text sample additional data was gathered in form of the [[counts.matrix.norm.tsv | RNASeq expression data]], the gene specific models with their lambda.min feature coefficients, the gene specific feature segments that were used as input by the regression.

## Data
The datasets that were explained in the gathering step of  [[OnlyZeroCoeffOLS]] were saved in the dir of PredictedVsActualExpression
