* In general the "best performing" model refers to the model which has the minimum cross validation error (MSE) and can be accessed in glmnet via lambda.min.

## Plot types
Marcel told to focus only on the Pearson driven feature (segment) preselection at the end of the segmentation and the Pearson values of the cross validation (Spearman less relevant). Laura thinks this might be because we use a linear model and Pearson measures linear relationship. I think this might be maybe because we are searching for Segment that directly have an influence on the gene Expression - if there are non linear relationships, there might be other processes involved and thus the effect might be more difficult to understand based on the data we have - we are focusing on detecting simple DNA accessibility driven correlations.
