## Description:
Dotplots to put the MSE Values in relation to the respective variation between the MSE values.

The script generates a dot plot visualization that represents the relationship between two variables, specifically `MSE` and `MSEVar`, from a given dataset. The plot is colored based on the density of the points, which helps in identifying areas of high data concentration. This is particularly useful in scenarios where the plot is crowded with many overlapping points.
