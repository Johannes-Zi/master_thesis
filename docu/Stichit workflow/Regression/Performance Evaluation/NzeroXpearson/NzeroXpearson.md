## Description:
Dotplot that puts the number of nonzero coefficients in perspective to their respective Pearson Values
## Code
https://github.com/Johannes-Zi/master_thesis/blob/main/regression/performance_evaluation/NzeroXpearson/NzeroXpearson.r

## Runs performed
plots were only generated for the Pearson based feature (segment) preselection at the end of the segmentation process

| Feature segment preselection after segmentation | Standard CV      | LeaveOneOut CV   |
