Generated in the context of the Stichit regression, representing a summary of  performances of all trained models. 
## ==General info!==
* standard k-fold cv: parameters to select how many folds (subset of the samples) per gene should be generated and how many samples are used for the outer cv reference set.
* LeaveOneOut cv: only one sample per fold, but for sample set of size n, there are n - folds created. Each sample is used once as outer cv sample.
* In general the "best performing" model refers to the model which has the minimum cross validation error (MSE) and can be accessed in glmnet via lambda.min.
