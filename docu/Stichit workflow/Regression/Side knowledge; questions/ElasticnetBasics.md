In the context of Elastic Net regression, `lambda` and `alpha` are hyperparameters that control the model's complexity and the balance between L1 and L2 regularization.

1. `lambda`: This is the regularization parameter, also known as the shrinkage parameter. It controls the amount of shrinkage that occurs by determining how much we penalize the complexity of the model. A larger value of `lambda` results in more regularization and a simpler model (which can help to prevent overfitting). A smaller value of `lambda`, on the other hand, allows the model to fit the data more closely, potentially leading to a more complex model (which can sometimes result in overfitting).
    
2. `alpha`: This is the mixing parameter that controls the balance between L1 (Lasso) and L2 (Ridge) regularization. If `alpha` is 0, the Elastic Net is equivalent to Ridge Regression, and if `alpha` is 1, it's equivalent to Lasso Regression. For values of `alpha` between 0 and 1, Elastic Net is a combination of Lasso and Ridge. This allows it to inherit some of the properties of both methods, such as the ability to handle multicollinearity (from Ridge) and perform feature selection (from Lasso).
