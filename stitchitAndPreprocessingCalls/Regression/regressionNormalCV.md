                    1 indicates a perfect positive monotonic relationship,
                    -1 indicates a perfect negative monotonic relationship, and
                    0 indicates no monotonic relationship. |  | measure used to evaluate the performance of a predictive model, particularly in regression analysis. It quantifies the average squared difference between the actual values (observed outcomes) and the predicted values produced by the model.
                
                A lower MSE indicates better agreement between the predicted and actual values, implying better model performance. |  | The p-value indicates the probability of observing the correlation coefficient (or one more extreme) under the null hypothesis that there is no correlation between the variables. It helps assess the statistical significance of the observed correlation coefficient. | False Discovery Rate (FDR): The FDR is the expected proportion of false discoveries among the rejected hypotheses. In other words, it's the rate at which you're willing to tolerate false positives.
                
                q-value: The q-value is a measure of the FDR. It represents the minimum FDR at which a hypothesis may be considered significant. In practical terms, a q-value of 0.05 indicates that you expect no more than 5% of the rejected hypotheses to be false positives. |  |

# Detailed workflow

1. Adaption of minimum number of input files for regression
    
    [Regression - minimum file number adaption](https://www.notion.so/Regression-minimum-file-number-adaption-cc4ef762df844673aa031d4cad460f98?pvs=21)
    
2. Installed missing R packages
    1. glmnet 
    2. doMC 1.3.8.
3. Error and updated Two_level_learning_elasticNet.R (error_1/)
    
    I encountered an error when running the Two_level_learning_elasticNet.R  script
    
    - error:
        
        ```bash
        Call:  cv.glmnet(x = x_train, y = y_train, nfolds = as.numeric(argsL$innerCV),      keep = TRUE, alpha = x)

        Execution halted
        ```
        
    
    Regarding to Laura, the error occurred because the program hasn’t captured a skipped regression for a single gene. The regression was skipped, because the inner cross validation generated a constant regression vector for one of the folds (happends when the expression in a fold is constant - e.g. 0 - This is a result of the sparsed dataset). The folds are subsets of the samples. Laura suggested to skip a problematic fold exactly once, if it appears for a gene, to reduce the number of genes that get lost due to this constant expression in the fold. But the selection of the folds is done with the Monte Carlo strategy(random folds), thus the occurance of the error is also random. Also the errors occur not only at the constant fold expression, but also there is sometimes no variance in the predictors or missing values in the table.
    
    Laura: “The scaling procedure was also corrected - the scaling is now performed only on the training data for each outer CV fold then the scaling parameters from the training data to scale the test data instead of scaling the whole feature matrix before starting the CV-procedure”
    
4. Additional error fix (error_2/)
    
    ```r
    Error in model.frame.default(formula = Expression ~ ., data = ols_Data,  : 
      'data' must be a data.frame, environment, or list
    Calls: lm -> eval -> eval -> <Anonymous> -> model.frame.default
    In addition: There were 50 or more warnings (use warnings() to see the first 50)
    Execution halted
    
    ```
    
    - Details:
        
        @laurarumpf2 I was able to reproduce the same error by performing 1000 iterations with ENSG00000133597 and ENSG00000133612.
        
        The input, output and the scripts are located at:
        
        /projects/pulmonary_hypertension/work/analysis/clinical_data_stichit_run/regression/error_2/error_reproduction/
        
        The stdout log of the affected iteration is:
        
        execution_iteration_873_stdout.log
        
        The whole stdout log is:
        
        loop_regression_[command.sh](http://command.sh/).log
        
        @johanneszieres1 thanks for the log file. I was able to identify the error: we only have 5 regions that were selected as features with the segmentation for the gene “ENSG00000133597“. After generating the elastic net model we have no non-zero coefficients, i.e. we could not learn anything from the input data with only 25 samples. I caught this error and also write a corresponding entry to the error log file.
        
5. Run regression
    
    ```jsx
    nohup bash perform_regression.sh > perform_regression.sh.log 2>&1 &
    ```
